# Artificial Intelligence: University Projects 🎓
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and models developed for the Artificial Intelligence course during undergraduate studies. The projects cover the implementation of expert systems (Fuzzy Logic) and the foundations of Machine Learning (Linear Regression and Neural Networks).

## 📂 Project Structure

1. Fuzzy Logic Systems
    * Implementation of expert systems using linguistic variables to handle uncertainty in decision-making.

    * Reservoir Level Control: A Fuzzy PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller designed to stabilize water levels.

    * Defuzzification Comparison: Scripts comparing different mathematical methods: Centroid, Weighted Average, and Mean of Maximum (MOM).

    * Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM): Implementation of rule matrices for acceleration and power control.

2. Machine Learning Foundations
    * Practical implementation of supervised learning models from scratch and using libraries.

    * Linear Regression: Predictive modeling using gradient descent to find the line of best fit.

    * Single Layer Perceptron (SLP): Implementation of the most basic artificial neuron for binary classification problems.

    * Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): Exploration of neural networks with hidden layers, backpropagation, and various activation functions.
